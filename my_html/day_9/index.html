         Studying is the main source of knowledge. Books are indeed never failing friends of man.
         For a mature mind, reading is the greatest source of pleasure and solace to distressed minds.
         The study of good books ennobles us and broadens our outlook. Therefore, the habit of reading should be cultivated. 
         A student should never confine himself to his schoolbooks only. He should not miss the pleasure locked in the classics, poetry, drama, history, philosophy etc.
