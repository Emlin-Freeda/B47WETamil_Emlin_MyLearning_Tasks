        <p>
            The roses most commonly used in perfumery are the Turkish rose, 
            the Damask (or Damascene rose) and Rosa Centifolia (the ‘hundred-leafed rose’), 
            which is grown around Grasse in the south of France, and generally considered to produce the highest quality rose absolute. 
            (This rose is also known as Rose de Mai, because it generally blooms in the month of May, a
            nd  – romantically – ‘the painter’s rose’, because it features in many works of the old masters.)
            </p>
            <p>Around 70% of the rose oil in the world comes from Bulgaria; 
            other significant producers are Turkey, Iran and Morocco, and precious,
           limited quantities from Grasse. The task of the rose-picker is to pick the dew-drenched blooms before 10 a.m. at the latest, 
           when the sun evaporates their exquisite magic. So fast does the rose fade, 
           in fact, that some farmers in Turkey and Bulgaria transport their own copper stills to the fields, 
           heating them on the spot over wood fires to distill the precious Damask Rose oil,
          which separates from the water when heated in only the tiniest of quantities: 
          170 rose flowers are said to relinquish but a single drop.
