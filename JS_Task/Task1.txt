Task 1:

1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
____________________________________________________________

Http:
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. 
By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. 

HTTP 1.1:
->The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. 
->Because it went through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. 

HTTP 2:
->In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.  
->HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. 
->One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.

Drawbacks that lead to the creation of HTTP/2: 
->The first problem is HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form. 
->The second one is head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other requests until the response does not receive. 
all the information related to the header file is repeated in every request.

Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2:
-->HTTP/1.1 works on the textual format and HTTP/2 works on the binary protocol
->In HTTP/1.1 head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it unitll it doesn't get all resources and In HTTP/2, it allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
->HTTP1/1.1 uses request resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages and HTTP/2 uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
->HTTP/1.1 compresses data by itself and HTTP/2 uses HPACK for data compression


2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
______________________________________________________________________________

What is Object in JavaScript?
->JavaScript object is a non-primitive data-type that allows you to store multiple collections of data.
7 types of primitive data types:
   ->string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint
->Booleans, Numbers, Strings can be defined as objects with the new keyword.
->Dates, Maths, Regular expressions, Arrays ,Functions  are always objects

example: 
let car = "Hyundai";

const myHonda = {
  color: "red",
  wheels: 4,
  engine: { cylinders: 4, size: 2.2 },
};

3.codekata practice:
______________________

->Helps guvi learner to practice coding problems
->quick IDE for workout problems
->multiple programming language one platform
->greate online editor

4.Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address
___________________________________________________________	

IP address:
->IP stands for internet protocol. 
->It is a unique number given to every device identified in a network. 
->Network-connected devices make use of IP addresses, which can be either public or private. 
->An example of an IP address is 192.158.1.38. IP addresses can range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. 
In any instance, no two devices can have the same IP address when connected to a network.

Port:
->Port number is a 16-bit logical address 
that is assigned to every application of your device and used to transmit data between computer network and application.
->We use this to identify the processes uniquely on a machine. This number can range from 0â€“65535.
Collectively, the IP address and port number form a socket address (socket number). This enables every single process to be uniquely identified over the internet.
->Port number 0 to 1023: Reserved Ports
->Port number 1024 to 49151: Registered Ports
->Port number 49151 to 65535: Dynamic ports

Http Methods:
GET
POST
PUT
HEAD
DELETE
PATCH
OPTIONS
CONNECT
TRACE

Important Methods:

GET:
->GET is used to request data from a specified resource.
->GET requests can be cached,browser history,  bookmarked.
->GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
->GET requests have length restrictions

POST:
->POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
->POST requests have no restrictions on data length

PUT:
PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
DELETE:
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

MAC Address:
->It stands for Media Access Control, and also known as Physical address, hardware address, or BIA (Burned In Address).
->It is globally unique; it means two devices cannot have the same MAC address.
->It is represented in a hexadecimal format on each device, such as 00:0a:95:9d:67:16.
->It is 12-digit, and 48 bits long, out of which the first 24 bits are used for OUI(Organization Unique Identifier), and 24 bits are for NIC/vendor-specific.
->It works on the data link layer of the OSI model
